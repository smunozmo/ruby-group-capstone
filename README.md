# Catalog of my things

In this project, we created a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you won: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything is based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files but we also prepared a database with tables structure analogical to our program's class structure.
